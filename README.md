# PCA-Machine-Learning

PCA stands for Principal Component Analysis. I have completed [Mathematics for Machine Learning: PCA](https://www.coursera.org/learn/pca-machine-learning) on **Coursera** which has these labs to be completed.

This intermediate-level course introduces the mathematical foundations to derive Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a fundamental dimensionality reduction technique. This course covers these basic topics. 

 - Basic statistics of data sets, such as mean values and variances.
 - Compute distances and angles between vectors using inner products and derive orthogonal projections of data onto lower-dimensional subspaces.
 - PCA as a method that minimizes the average squared reconstruction error between data points and their reconstruction.
